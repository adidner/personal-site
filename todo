figure out how I want to design project pages
    - personal and professional
    - possibly / to a card based page with a brief description, when clicked goes to a / page with more details and such
    - alternatively just a / with everything ordered in decending with a side menu that takes you down to a specific section

cement designs of particular pages via low fidelity mockups, based on a combination of other peoples examples and my own inclination

setup nav bar navigation to everything in such a way that commenting out sections is nice and easy

do all the pages
    - some easy win pages include, /interestingasides/*, hobbies/piano, hobbies/cooking?
    - other priorities include /root and /personalproject and /professional projects which are the most important to have at least somewhat complete before publishing

get a domain (probably aarondidner.me)

host with netlify or huroku or maybe try both or something idk
