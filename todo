TIKTOKS

Make some paging system for tik toks such that we can do some form of lazy loading that doesn't suck quite so much

Maybe do some testing and see in what fashion this is actually and issue and how it can be resolved and such




READING/BOOKS

F̶o̶o̶l̶ a̶r̶o̶u̶n̶d̶ w̶i̶t̶h̶ c̶s̶s̶ g̶r̶i̶d̶ a̶n̶d̶ g̶e̶t̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ t̶h̶e̶ p̶a̶g̶e̶ o̶f̶ c̶o̶m̶p̶a̶r̶i̶s̶o̶n̶s̶ t̶o̶ l̶o̶o̶k̶ c̶l̶e̶a̶n̶e̶r̶?̶ O̶r̶ a̶ t̶a̶b̶l̶e̶?̶

Make a modal card for the hobbies/reading page and make the read stuff pull up said card

Make a mini card for the favorites books page and have it pull up the modal card onClick






























setup nav bar navigation to everything in such a way that commenting out sections is nice and easy
setup scss to do some nice things for me here

get a domain (probably aarondidner.me)

host with netlify or huroku or maybe try both or something idk



figure out how I want to design project pages
    - personal and professional
    - possibly / to a card based page with a brief description, when clicked goes to a / page with more details and such
    - alternatively just a / with everything ordered in decending with a side menu that takes you down to a specific section

cement designs of particular pages via low fidelity mockups, based on a combination of other peoples examples and my own inclination



do all the pages
    - some easy win pages include, /interestingasides/*, hobbies/piano, hobbies/cooking?
    - other priorities include /root and /personalproject and /professional projects which are the most important to have at least somewhat complete before publishing



add site to resume
