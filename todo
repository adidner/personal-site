TIKTOKS

Make some paging system for tik toks such that we can do some form of lazy loading that doesn't suck quite so much

Maybe do some testing and see in what fashion this is actually and issue and how it can be resolved and such

a good method for really long title like the subtle art of not giving a f*ck































setup nav bar navigation to everything in such a way that commenting out sections is nice and easy
setup scss to do some nice things for me here

get a domain (probably aarondidner.me)

host with netlify or huroku or maybe try both or something idk



figure out how I want to design project pages
    - personal and professional
    - possibly / to a card based page with a brief description, when clicked goes to a / page with more details and such
    - alternatively just a / with everything ordered in decending with a side menu that takes you down to a specific section

cement designs of particular pages via low fidelity mockups, based on a combination of other peoples examples and my own inclination



do all the pages
    - some easy win pages include, /interestingasides/*, hobbies/piano, hobbies/cooking?
    - other priorities include /root and /personalproject and /professional projects which are the most important to have at least somewhat complete before publishing



add site to resume
